## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

<div style = "text-align: justify">
This is our Tetris game project for the Object-Oriented Programming course at HCMIU in Semester 1 (2023-2024). We all knew that the game is a classic, but it will demonstrate the valuable experiences we learn in the course. We hope you enjoy it!
(Maybe has some feature and update in future!)

## Game <a name="Game"></a>

|  Key  |          Action          |
|:-----:|:------------------------:|
| DOWN  | Tetrominoes down faster  |
| LEFT  | Move tetrominoes to left |
| RIGHT | Move tetrominoes to right|
| ENTER | Rotation of tetrominoes  |
|   P   |          Pause           |

<div style = "text-align: justify">
The objective of the game is to manipulate falling blocks called tetrominoes to create horizontal lines without any gaps.
Once a line is completed, it disappears, and the player earns points. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.

## Features <a name="Features"></a>
Tetris is a simple classic game, so we tried to make it according to our understanding to see how much experience we have.
If we talk about the features we think of for the future, there might be some interesting game modes like water or sand mino.
Moreover, we have an idea that have some items for game like bonus point, or speed up(down)
